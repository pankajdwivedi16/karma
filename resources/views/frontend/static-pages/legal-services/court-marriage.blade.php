          <h2>Court Marriage</h2>
          <div class="slices"><span class="slice"></span><span class="slice"></span><span class="slice"></span>
            <p style="color:black;">A court marriage means that the marriage between a male and female are performed according to the law irrespective of their caste, religion or creed. When two people opt to get married in the court, there is no need to perform the marriage rituals according to their religion, rather the marriage takes place in court before a Marriage Officer. </p>
            <p style="color:black;">A court marriage in India is solemnised as per the Special Marriage Act, 1954. The marriage registration is conditional to the provisional of the Act and a marriage certificate is issued by the Marriage Officer in presence of three witnesses.</p>
