    A trademark speaks for the organisation. It stands as an identity of the representation of the organisation. The trademark of your organisation is your property and it only belongs to you. The use of your trademark for any illegal reason gives you the right to take legal actions on the person.<br>
    <br>
    After the company is started, it should register for a trademark. The Trade mark can be renewed after every ten years. The renewal of the Trademark time to time is very important.
