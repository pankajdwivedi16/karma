      <h2>Limited Liability Partnership</h2>
      The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008  introduced the Limited Liability Partnership in India. This is totally different from the other company formation norms. The good thing about the LLP is in the partnership process one partner will not be accountable for the fault of the other partner. For a business , the associated partners have the right to control the business. <br>
      <br>
      Contrary to unlimited partnership, in an LLP, one partner cannot be held accountable for another partner’s negligence and misconduct. This is a salient feature of LLP and might be the biggest reason behind its rising popularity in India. In an LLP, all associated partners come together to get form of limited liability for each individual’s protection with the partnership, alike the shareholders of a business. However, unlike corporate shareholders, the partners have the authority to run the business directly. An LLP also bounds the personal liability of a partner for the faults, oversights, incompetence, or negligence of the LLP's employees or other agents. With regards to the partner’s involvement, there will be separate legal entity.<br>
